# Advent of Code 2024

The Rust programs are located in [`src/bin`](src/bin/) and are named as `DD-P.rs`, where DD is the day (0-24) and P is the part (1 or 2), e.g. `01-1.rs` for the first day and first part.

The programs expect the puzzle input on stdin. The puzzle input can be saved in a file and then piped to the program, for example:

```bash
$ cat 01.txt | cargo run --bin 01-1
```
